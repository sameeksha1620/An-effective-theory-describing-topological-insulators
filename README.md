Green’s function approach to Chern-Simons extended electrodynamics

This repository contains code and analysis related to the investigation of boundary effects in Chern-Simons extended electrodynamics using the Green's function approach. The project explores the behavior of electromagnetic fields within bounded regions and their interactions with a parity-violating scalar field θ.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on three main aspects:

1. **Chern-Simons Extension**: Analysis of the θ scalar field's impact on electrodynamics within bounded regions, extending the Maxwell Lagrangian to include the parity-violating term.

2. **Green's Function Method**: Application of the Green's function method to solve field equations modified by the θ term, particularly in static cases. This approach allows computation of electromagnetic fields on either side of the θ interface.

3. **Applications**: Calculation of pointlike charge fields near planar θ boundaries, determination of charge-boundary forces using various methods, and exploration of effects induced by infinitely straight current-carrying wires in proximity to θ interfaces.
